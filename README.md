# Self-Supervised Learning with Contrastive and Reconstruction Losses
Implementation of a self-supervised learning model trained with contrastive and reconstruction losses on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This repository contains the code for a self-supervised learning model trained with contrastive and reconstruction losses. The model is implemented using the CIFAR-10 dataset and an encoder-decoder architecture.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Implement a self-supervised learning approach using contrastive and reconstruction losses.
- **Data**: CIFAR-10 dataset
- **Model Architecture**: Encoder-decoder with contrastive and reconstruction losses
- **Training Procedure**: Simultaneous training with pairs of images
- **Evaluation**: Analysis of learned representations and effectiveness of contrastive and reconstruction losses
- **Future Steps**: Further experiments, application of learned representations for downstream tasks
